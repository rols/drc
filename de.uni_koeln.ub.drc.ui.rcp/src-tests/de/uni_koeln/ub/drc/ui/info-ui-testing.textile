h1. Basic setup for UI testing of the DRC editor with WindowTester

* Install WindowTester (see their documentation for details and basic usage)
* Set up a recording session with the DRC product and WindowTester bundles
* Pass login credentials as VM arguments, e.g. @-Duser.name=fsteeg@ and @-Duser.pass=drc@
* When the editor is running, press the record button, use the editor, close it, and save the resulting test
* Fix the MANIFEST by making the RAP and UI bundles optional (overwritten by WindowTester)
* Run the generated test as a JUnit Plug-in test with the correct product and VM arguments as above, and all bundles

This folder contains some very basic sample tests, which can be executed by running the included launch config.
