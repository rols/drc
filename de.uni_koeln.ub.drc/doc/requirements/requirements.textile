h2. Problem Definition

The Romansch Chrestomathy (RC), the most important collection of texts in the "Romansch language":http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=roh, is not available in high quality full text, and therefore not searchable or machine-readable. While being written in Latin script, the use of diacritics and historical typography prevent the creation of a high quality corpus by simple OCR alone, which can be seen in a "digitization effort":http://www.archive.org/details/rtoromanischech00camigoog of the RC by Google. A complete, reliable evaluation of the RC digitization quality is only possible by native speakers of Romansch. A similar situation is true for many other linguistic minorities.

h2. Requirements Specification

Below we summarize both functional requirements and quality requirements. These are largely based on our proposal approved by the "DFG":http://www.dfg.de/en/. Where available, we map the requirements to layers (data, logic, presentation for now) and components (to be determined), as well as to concrete issues in our "issue tracker":http://github.com/fsteeg/drc/issues. This is work in progress.

h3. Functional Requirements

Functional requirements for each work package:

h4. WP1: Metadata
